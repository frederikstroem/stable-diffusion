# Stable Diffusion Results
Some great results achieved using [Stable Diffusion 2](https://github.com/Stability-AI/stablediffusion) on an Nvidia 1070 Founders Edition.

All images are stored inside the `/assets/img/` directory in this repository.

I have saved an example Jupyter Notebook in this repository, `stable-diffusion.ipynb`, showcasing in broad terms my own setup. **NOTE:** Prompts are saved in a `prompts.txt` file alongside the Jupyter Notebook, allowing for modifications of the selected prompts in runtime.

The image parameters are also saved alongside the generated images, allowing for easy recreation and modifications.
